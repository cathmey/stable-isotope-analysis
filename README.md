The code in this repository accompanies the manuscript "Sociality drives patterns of foraging ecology in a highly mobile marine predator" submitted to the Journal of Animal Ecology in September 2025.

Note that the code for Figure 1 produces map and data points only, additional editing was done in PowerPoint. Code for Figure 2 is not available as this was created in PopArt V1.7. Code for Figures 4A, 4B, S3 and S5 can be found within "nicheROVER_analysis_Github_Code.R".
